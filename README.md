# Muny-Bot


Hi this repo is where I'm going to be playing with discord.js to create a bot for the Discord client. This is the [guide](https://discordjs.guide/#/) I'm using to build my bot.

## Want to join?

Here is the [invitation](https://discord.gg/QBbjjF) link to join Joe's-Bot-Lab and play with the bot. Muny-bot is still young and impressionable, so I won't hesitate to ban you if I think you're going to lead Muny-bot astray.

TODOS: //
* thinking about structure of bot.

  -> index contains `Client.on(*action*)'s`

  -> imports modules/functions to deal with the 'action' cases.
