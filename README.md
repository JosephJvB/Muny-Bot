# Muny-Bot


Hi this repo is where I'm going to be playing with discord.js to create a bot for the Discord client. This is the [guide](https://discordjs.guide/#/) I'm using to build my bot.

## Want to join?

Here is the [invitation](https://discord.gg/QBbjjF) link to join Joe's-Bot-Lab and play with the bot. Muny-bot is still young and impressionable, so I won't hesitate to ban you if I think you're going to lead Muny-bot astray.

Oh by the way I'm the only one that can run the server. I didn't think that through. Message me on discord. I'm happy to chat about the bot.

  -> create a custom emoji library to export from? eg: `import { map, hunnid } from './emojies`

---

### FILE STRUCTURE: //


  -> A top level index. Contains `Client.on(*event*)'s`

  -> imports bot modules (event handlers) to deal with the 'event' cases.
  - eg: { handle_message, handle_join ... } = require('./src/events')

    -> Right so their event/command structure is nice since all their commands are objects, it means when a user calls !help on a command, they can list the object to describe it to the user it seems.
    Just means my !help command is gonna be a bit beefy :)

### SYNTAX: //

I'm having a go at not using camelCase:
  - kebab case for file names. `kebab-case`
  - train case for variables. `train_case`
